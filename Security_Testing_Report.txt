PROJECT TITLE:

Web Application Security Testing

DESCRIPTION:

This project focuses on conducting manual security testing on a sample web application to identify common web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

The testing was performed on an intentionally vulnerable demo application for educational and ethical testing purposes.

OBJECTIVES:

Identify security vulnerabilities in a web application.

Understand common web security risks.

Document findings and recommend mitigation strategies.

TESTED APPLICATION:

Altoro Mutual
URL: https://demo.testfire.net/

TESTING TYPE:

Manual Security Testing

TOOLS USED:

Web Browser (Google Chrome)

Visual Studio Code (for documentation)

VULNERABILITY DETAILS
1. SQL INJECTION

Description:
SQL Injection attack was tested on the login page by entering a malicious SQL payload in the username field.

Test Payload Used:

' OR 1=1 --

Testing Steps:

Navigate to login page.

Enter the payload in username field.

Enter random password.

Click Login.

Expected Result:
Application should reject invalid login credentials.

Actual Result:
The application allowed login without valid credentials and bypassed authentication.

Risk Level: High

Impact:
An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive account information.

Status: Vulnerable

2. CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING (XSS)

Description:
XSS vulnerability was tested by injecting a JavaScript payload into an input field.

Test Payload Used:

<script>alert('XSS')</script>

Testing Steps:

Navigate to input field (search or form).

Enter the payload.

Submit the request.

Expected Result:
Application should not execute the script.

Actual Result:
An alert popup appeared, indicating script execution.

Risk Level: Medium

Impact:
An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the user’s browser and steal session data.

Status: Vulnerable

RECOMMENDATIONS:

Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.

Implement proper input validation and sanitization.

Apply output encoding to prevent XSS.

Implement secure coding practices.

CONCLUSION:

The tested web application was found vulnerable to SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). These vulnerabilities can lead to serious security risks such as unauthorized access and execution of malicious scripts. Proper security controls must be implemented to mitigate these issues.
